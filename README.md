In the root directory create a directory called `apiUrls` and inside that directory create a js file called `apiUrls.js`. 

Add the api endpoints in `apiUrls.js`. It should look like this:
```javascript
export const ARTICLE_URL = 'enter_your_article_endpoint_here';
export const TOPIC_URL = 'enter_your_topic_endpoint_here';
```
Use `npm start` to start the dev server.
